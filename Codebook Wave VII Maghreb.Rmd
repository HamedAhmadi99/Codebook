#### Overview of Data:
The Wave VII Maghreb dataset derives from Arab Barometer's Wave VII survey, focusing on the Maghreb regionâ€”Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. This dataset includes cleaned and coded responses from adults aged 18 and above, providing insights into the socio-political sentiments within these countries.

#### Sources and Methodology:
Data is sourced from Arab Barometer's Wave VII survey, renowned for its robust methodology ensuring national representativeness and reliability. Our dataset has undergone extensive cleaning and coding, aligning with Arab Barometer's technical reports to maintain data integrity and reliability. Surveys were conducted via PAPI, CAPI, and phone interviews, employing multistage probability sampling.

#### Note on Missing Values:
Missing values are noted where responses were not provided, or the data was not applicable. These are coded as 'NA' within the dataset and should be considered during analysis to avoid skewing results.

#### Data Usage and Interpretation:
Researchers should consult the original Arab Barometer documentation to understand sampling and fieldwork procedures fully. This dataset's quality and coding adhere to Arab Barometer's standards, and thus, their documentation is crucial for accurate data interpretation.

#### Acknowledgments:
This dataset builds upon Arab Barometer's meticulous survey efforts in the MENA region. We thank them for setting a high standard in data collection and transparency, which has been foundational in creating the Wave VII Maghreb dataset.
