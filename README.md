# Wave VII Maghreb Dataset

# Overview
This dataset and accompanying codebook were developed as part of the class project for SIS-750-007: Data Analysis at the School of International Service (SIS), American University, during the Spring of 2024. Focusing on the Maghreb region—Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia—this dataset originates from the Arab Barometer's Wave VII survey. It includes responses that have been meticulously cleaned and recoded to provide a detailed insight into the socio-political sentiments prevalent in these countries.

# Data Source
